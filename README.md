# DndBeyond Developer Challenge

I am excited at the opportunity to work the the DndBeyond and Cortext teams!
I have completed both code exercises, and have included notes on my implementations in the respective README files.

- [Front-End Developer Challenge](UI/README.md)
- [Cortex Back End Developer Challenge](API/README.md)
